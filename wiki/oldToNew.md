```SQL
SELECT titre, NULL as tag, url as nom_video, description, videos.date as `date`, 0 as is_diff, 1 as is_private, 1 as id_user, 0 as score, 1 as id_image, id FROM `videos` WHERE 1

Remplacer :
+ `url` par `nom_video`
+ `videos` par `Video`

```sql
SELECT url as titre,date,(id + 1000) as id FROM `videos` INNER JOIN image__exist ON nom = url WHERE 1
```

```sql
